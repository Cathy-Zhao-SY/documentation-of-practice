The second image is a screen shot of my online research. This is a video that talks about a South Korean mom had a reunion with her daughter after her daughter passed away in the real life. This evoked emotions of this mother and achieve the goal to meet her daughter once again though it was kinda inhuman for some people. This is related with moral issue whether people should use technology to reminisce the dead people.
